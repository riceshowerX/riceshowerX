## 🚀 My Mission

> "Building bridges between business innovation and technical possibility, one experiment at a time."

As a curious mind at the intersection of **business development** and **web technologies**, I love exploring how technical solutions can create meaningful digital experiences. My journey is guided by equal parts caffeine and curiosity.
